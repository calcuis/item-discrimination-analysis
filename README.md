# item-discrimination-analysis
an example of a Python function that performs item discrimination analysis

```

This function takes a list of responses to a multiple choice item (where 1 indicates a correct response and 0 indicates an incorrect response) and returns the item discrimination index, which is a measure of how well the item discriminates between students (testees) who are more and less knowledgeable about the subject matter. A high discrimination index indicates that the item effectively differentiates between students (testees) who know the material and those who do not.
